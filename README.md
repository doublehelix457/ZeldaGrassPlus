# ZeldaGrassPlus

Updated version of the original ZeldaGrass plugin for bukkit/Spigot and PaperSpigot! All credit/rights go to the original author Errored!

ZeldaGrass+
A lightweight and easy plugin to use. There is a 5/1000 chance of getting "Rupees" (Emeralds) and "Hearts" (Health) when you cut grass with any sword. Added "Blue Rupees" (Diamonds) for a 1/1000 chance.

How to use
Toss it in your plugins folder! There are still no permissions. Nothing needs to be configured by default in the config file. However, if you're feeling brave, you can now modify the Item Type dropped, the drop rate and the message!
